v0.9.0 (January 2019)
----------------------

#. Patch bug that will crash FASTA sequence output when sequence identifier is a number.
#. Adds utility function to change the text of a legend on plotting.
#. Adds function to ensure logic in fragment data is properly kept.
#. Adds function to mix fragment data.
#. Adds function to concatenate fragment data.
#. Adds function to generate qgrids as per the  `qgrid library <https://qgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This is a simple wrapper that just makes sure that the ``html div`` overflows if the number of columns is too high. Adds a soft requirement to the library.
#. Adds method :meth:`.DesignFrame.clean_rosetta_suffix` to clean Rosetta ``_0001`` suffixes (use with caution)
#. Adds ability to read from different single-chain Poses with different chain identifier :ref:`into the same column <readrosetta>`.
#. Add the ability to compare design populations with ``real data``.
#. Improved plotting control over axis in some multi-axis functions, notably in Ramachandran and LOGO plots.
