v0.7.0 (August 2018)
--------------------

#. Command line scripts attached to the distribution.
#. ``check_mutants`` script adapts itself to the number of sequences.
#. ``DesignFrame`` function for sequence/structure global frequencies are ``key_residue`` aware.
#. ``DesignFrame`` mutant functions can work with list-type ``key_residue``.
#. Added ability to read phi/psi angles from Rosetta output and plot Ramachandran.
#. Added ability to read HMMsearch output.
#. Descriptions to load silent files can be provided as YAML.
#. Read json-formated Rosetta score files.
#. Select a different ``seqID`` for fasta reading.
#. Sequence distance can be calculated against a different ``DesignFrame``.
#. Plot data from a 96-well microplate.
#. Read and plot **SPR** data.
#. Read and plot **CD** spectra.
#. Formatted plots for **Thermal Melt**, and **MALS**.
#. Read and process **Next Generation Sequencing** data.
#. Function to plot per residue score after applying a similarity matrix.
#. Ability to execute the mutant variants to obtain scores for the new suggested mutations with ``apply_resfile``.
#. ``generate_mutant_variants`` allows to explore all residue types for a position with '*'.
#. Keep silent file instead of minisilent after running ``get_sequence_and_structure`` allows better integration with ``apply_resfile``.
#. Function to plot per residue score after applying a similarity matrix
#. Adding logo plot color schemes.
#. Added population and positional enrichment for comparison between two sequence populations.
